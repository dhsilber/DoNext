# Do Next

Do Next will show me the next few things that I need to do alongside my daily repeating tasks.

The repeating tasks are all about building habits. 
It feels good to check them off my list every day, but ideally I'll do them even without the reminders.

Other tasks are difficult.
I (like many people) have a huge pile of things I would like to get done.
A simple prioritization doesn't really cut it.
Many tasks / projects are things that are constrained in some way.
(E.g. appointment for vision test must be made during business hours.)
Tasks which are not eligible for doing right now should not be competing for my attention with other tasks.
OTOH, things that block tasks might themselves be tasks. ("Buy nails for birdhouse project")

Right now *Do Next* just shows a list of todo items, which doesn't look like much.
OTOH, it will ingest & download the set of todo items and keep them in the browser's local storage, so they are instantly available when the app is reloaded.
